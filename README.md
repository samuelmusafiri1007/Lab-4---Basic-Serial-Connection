# Lab-4---Basic-Serial-Connection
Basic Serial Connection with troubleshooting and IP configuration
- In this lab, use cdp protocol to identify information about my directly connected devices, and interfaces are connected to which
- I then identify which serial0 link is DCE and DTE
- I set the DCE clock rate to 64000 which is 64Kbps
- I conifure the IP addresses on both routers
- And test connectivity using ping command
